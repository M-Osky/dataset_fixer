This are some old versions. I don't recommend them, but it's true that they are less complex and easier to use.

Main dataset_fixer has no help information, the first lines of the script briefly explain its use.
Only two arguments can be passed from command line:
  - input file path/name (string).
  - number of characters of the population name code in the individual tag (integer)
  
Everything about the input file format and most of the pipeline is the same than in the main updated version (see readme)
Most of the modules have their own Help information, I specially recommend to check missing_replacer help to understand the parameters

To see the help information of the modules you can use any help flag: h -h --h help -help --help
